# CI Prebuild (armv7, cross-toolchain + binary attempts)

Phase A now does two things:

1. Prepare a Linux armv7 cross-build platform in GitHub Actions
2. Attempt to produce **two armv7l-linux bins** for handoff:
   - `bun` armv7 probe binary (hello sample first)
   - `bun` armv7 source-build attempt binary
   - `opencode` armv7 binary (compiled only when package source is available)

## Why this approach

Upstream armv7 release URLs are unreliable or unavailable. The workflow still records release asset evidence, but the main path is now **attempt-based source/compile execution** with preserved logs.

## Success condition (Phase A target)

Artifact contains both files (or their build logs explaining blockers):

- `assets/bun-hello-linux-armv7` (or future `bun-linux-armv7`)
- `assets/opencode-linux-armv7`

## Debug loop

- Trigger workflow by push/workflow_dispatch
- Download artifact bundle
- Inspect:
- `logs/build-bun-armv7.log`
- `logs/build-bun-armv7-source.log`
- `logs/build-opencode-armv7.log`
- `status/*.json`
- `status/build-attempt-status.json`

This keeps CI iterations fast and makes failures actionable.

## Native runner setup guide

See `docs/armv7-native-runner-setup.md` for the self-hosted armv7 runner checklist (labels, dependencies, verification, and artifact inspection).

## Native armv7 fallback job

When cross-build signals indicate `native_required: true`, run workflow dispatch with:

- `run_native_armv7 = true`

This triggers a second job that requires a self-hosted runner with labels:

- `self-hosted`
- `linux`
- `armv7`

The job runs `scripts/ci/build-bun-armv7-native.sh` and uploads `armv7-native-bun-fallback` artifact.

If no such runner exists, keep using cross-build job for diagnosis until runner infrastructure is ready.
